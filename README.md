:warning: 
The official version of the training material is available in [Papyrus repository](https://git.eclipse.org/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus.git)
 - Built against [Eclipse Photon](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/photon) (This example is only tested against Eclipse Photon release train)
 - This is material used for training and example, it shouldn't be taken as an architectural reference:
	- profile plugin shouldn't have any dependencies to Papyrus
	- tests should be done using one fragment for each plugin
	- elementtype should be hosted in an independent plugin
	- ui element should probably be grouped in the same plugin
	- css files are duplicated to demonstrate local css capabilities

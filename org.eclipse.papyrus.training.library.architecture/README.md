==Basic Concepts==

The architecture metamodel in Papyrus is implemented as a realization and an extension to the ISO 42010 standard for architecture of systems. Hence many concepts present in the metamodel are derived from those presented in the ISO 42010 standard. However, the standard has been extended with Papyrus-specific concepts and properties.
* A ''domain'' is the root of the architecture model. It can contains a collection of ''concerns'', ''stakeholders'', as well as ''contexts'' (which can be ''description languages'' and/or ''frameworks'').
* A ''concern'' (from ISO 42010) represents in Papyrus a matter of interest to some stakeholder.
* A ''stakeholder'' (from ISO 42010) represents in Papyrus an archetype of users. It references a set of its ''concerns''.
* A ''description language'' (from ISO 42010) represents in Papyrus a modeling language (e.g., UML, SysML). It has a unique ''id' that corresponds to that of an ''IClientContext'' from GMF. It references a ''metamodel'', a set of ''profiles'', a set of ''element type set configurations'', a ''creation command'' (creates a model of this language), a ''conversion command'' (converts a model to this language), and and ''icon''. It also has an optional ''extension prefix'' for its models. It can also contain a set of ''representation kinds'' (which can be either ''diagrams'' or ''tables'') and a set of ''viewpoints''.
* A ''framework'' (from ISO 42010) represents in Papyrus a modeling framework (e.g., DoDAF). It has a unique ''id' that corresponds to that of an ''IClientContext'' from GMF. It references a set of ''element type set configurations'', a ''creation command'' (creates a model of this framework), a ''conversion command'' (converts a model to this framework), and an ''icon''. It also has an optional ''extension prefix'' for its models. It can also contain a set of ''viewpoints''.
* A ''viewpoint'' (from ISO 42010) in Papyrus references set of ''representation kinds'', which can be ''diagrams'' or ''tables''.
* A ''diagram'' in this context does not represent a single instance (for example the diagram named X in model Y), but the specification (or prototype) of future diagrams of this kind. For example the ''UML Class Diagram''.
* A ''table'' is another kind of view in Papyrus that enables the presentation of models in a tabular format.
